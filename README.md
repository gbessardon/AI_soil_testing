# AI_soil_testing
This github gather the different attempts to extend the Irish national soil dataset using AI in a similar way as the TOPSOIL dataset 
Ballabio, C., Panagos, P. and Monatanarella, L. 2016. Mapping topsoil physical properties at European scale using the LUCAS database. Geoderma.
The R folder contains an attempt in R to reproduce the method but was not successful
The document http://geologyandpython.com/ml-interpolation-method.html shows how to use machine learning in python to predict spatial data.
The folder model example includes a notebook which tests manually different method including Earth which is used in Ballabio et al. 2016
The folder AutoML includes tests using automated machine learning method choice using Tpot https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot
